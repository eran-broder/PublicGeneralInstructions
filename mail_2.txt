Subject: AI that ships your fixes. Live demo at NTL DEPLOY
Date: Tue, 23 Sep 2025 10:49:20 -0700

Summary:
Netlify is announcing their NTL DEPLOY online launch event on October 1st, focusing on AI tools that can turn prompts into production code. The email addresses a common developer pain point: while AI can write code for small bugs and low-priority fixes, deploying them is still a hassle.

Key promises:
- Fix "someday" tasks in minutes
- Go from prompt to deploy without leaving your workflow
- See real developers using Netlify AI in production
- New ways to build with AI by combining favorite agents into shippable workflows

The event will show live demos of these new deployment capabilities. Registration is available even for those who can't attend live, with replay access provided.
